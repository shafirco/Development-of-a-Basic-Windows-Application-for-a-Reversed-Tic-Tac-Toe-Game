The task involves developing a basic yet complex Windows application that recreates a reversed Tic-Tac-Toe game. The primary objectives are to practice working with controls, events, and form design. The application will allow users to set game parameters, including player names and board size, and will feature interactive buttons to capture player moves. It includes handling win and draw scenarios with appropriate messages. Bonus points are available for implementing event-driven updates between the logical and presentation layers.
