In this project, I developed a Windows application that recreates a reversed Tic-Tac-Toe game. The application allows users to set game parameters, including player names and board size, and features interactive buttons to capture player moves. The system handles win and draw scenarios with appropriate messages. The primary objectives were to practice working with controls, events, and form design. Additionally, I implemented event-driven updates to ensure synchronization between the logical and presentation layers, enhancing the user experience. This project showcases my ability to develop complex yet intuitive user interfaces using C#.
